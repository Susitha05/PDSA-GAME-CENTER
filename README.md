# PDSA-GAME-CENTER

📖 Project Description

This project is a full-stack Game Application built using Spring Boot, MySQL, and React.
The main purpose of this system is to provide a structured backend to manage game data and a responsive frontend for player interactions.

The backend (Spring Boot) exposes REST APIs to handle operations such as storing player details, recording high scores, and managing game sessions.
The frontend (React) communicates with these APIs to display game information, update game progress, and provide a smooth user interface for players.
MySQL is used as the database to store all persistent game-related data.

This project is designed to help beginners understand how a modern full-stack application works, especially in the context of game development where real-time data and interactions are important.
