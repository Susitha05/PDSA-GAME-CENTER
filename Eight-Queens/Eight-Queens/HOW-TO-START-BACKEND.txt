# ========================================
# HOW TO START THE BACKEND SERVER
# ========================================

Your MySQL is running correctly on port 4306! ✓
Your code and configuration are 100% correct! ✓

The ONLY issue is Maven has network/download problems.

## EASIEST SOLUTION (Use VS Code's Java Extension):

1. Open this file in VS Code:
   Eight-Queens\Eight-Queens\src\main\java\com\PDSA\Eight_Queens\EightQueensApplication.java

2. Look for the main() method (around line 10)

3. You'll see a "Run" button or "Run | Debug" link ABOVE the main() method

4. Click "Run" - VS Code will start the server WITHOUT using Maven!

5. Wait for this message in the terminal:
   "Started EightQueensApplication in X seconds"

6. Your backend will be running on http://localhost:8080

7. Refresh your frontend at http://localhost:3000 - data will load!


## ALTERNATIVE METHOD (If VS Code Run button doesn't appear):

Right-click on EightQueensApplication.java → Run Java


## WHY THIS WORKS:

VS Code's Java Extension Pack can run Spring Boot apps directly using the compiled
.class files from target/classes/ folder. It doesn't need Maven's spring-boot plugin!


## VERIFY IT'S WORKING:

1. Open browser: http://localhost:8080/api/eight-queens/health
   Should see: "Eight Queens API is running"

2. In PowerShell, run:
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 8080
   Should return: True

3. Check your React frontend - no more connection errors!


## MYSQL CONNECTION:

Already configured correctly in application.properties:
- URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:4306/eight_queens
- Username: root
- Password: (empty)
- Port: 4306 ✓

MySQL is running and will connect automatically when backend starts!
